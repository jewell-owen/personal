                <h3><strong>Project 1: Adoption App</strong></h3>
                <h4>Computer Science 309: Software Development Practices</h4>
                <p>The first project is for a semester long project in a group of four.
                    For this project we could choose any topic we wanted. We chose to 
                    develop an app that would make it eaiser for both a user and an
                    adoption center to have a successfull and easy adoption process. 
                    This project is still currently being developed but the main idea is 
                    to allow users to view adoption center's pet postings to direct message 
                    questions or schedule an appoinment. I was part of the front end team 
                    but also worked a bit on the backend. I learned about Andorid programming 
                    in Android Studio as well as the back end framework SpringBoot. I also learned
                    Git on a much deeper level.

                <h3><strong>Project 2: Portfolio Website</strong></h3>
                <h4>Computer Science 319: Construction of User Interfaces</h4>
                <p>The second project was to develop a single web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. I worked on this project alone.
                    The project consists of creating a single web page with a menu at 
                    the top known as the Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing 
                    ourself and text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself. This project was the starting point
                    for this website. Through this project and class I learned about HTML, CSS,
                    and JavaScript.</p>

                <h3><strong>Project 3: Smart Motorcycle Helmet and App</strong></h3>
                <h4>Computer Engineering 186: Intro to Computer Engineering II</h4>
                <p>The third project was for a semester long project class that was 
                    done in a group of three. We were allowed to choose any topic for 
                    our project. This project was built with Flutter (a Google cross-platform 
                    app development framework). We used Arduino Nano sensors combined 
                    with a crash detection algorithm to broadcast an SMS text message.
                    This was done using Bluetooth low energy amd it was sent to a list 
                    of emergency contacts using Twilio API in the event a motorcyle 
                    crash was detetced. Through this project I learned Dart and the framework
                    Flutter. I also leanred a bit of C++ through the Arduino IDE. Lastly, I 
                    learned the basics of Git.
