Hello, my name is Owen Jewell and this is my personal portfolio website.
I am majoring in Computer Engineering with a minor in Cyber Security.
You can reach me at ojewell1073@gmail.com.Y
This website was originally created with just HTML and CSS for a required class in order to turn in an ethics essay.
After I finish the personal project I am currently working on, I plan to enhance this through JavaScript and most likley turning it into a React web application to improve the design.
